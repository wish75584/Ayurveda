<div><p>	<span style="font-size: 25px">A</span>shwagandha, sometimes named “winter cherry” or “withania," is a top mental rejuvenator.  Ayurvedic herbalists use the herb to reestablish long-term sleep rhythms. Ayurvedic herbalism also uses ashwagandha for general strength and support in times of occasional fatigue and exhaustion, and to support healthy memory and a strong nervous system
</p>

<p>This tonic herb, a relative of tomatoes and potatoes, is not stimulating, but rather relaxing. This allows one to use ashwagandha in larger amounts on a regular basis without concern for overstimulation, so this root is a superb remedy for nervous system support</p>

<p>As well as being a slow-acting tonic herb, ashwagandha is a superb herb for balancing elevated vata, a common problem as age advances. It takes about a week to work up to an appropriate amount, and about another week for the herb to reach maximum effectiveness. Since ashwagandha is a slow-acting herb, you may take your daily serving at any time during the day.</p>
