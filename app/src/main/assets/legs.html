	<li><h2>Coffee to Make Cellulite Fade Fast</h2>Don't throw out those coffee grounds you used to brew your morning cup—apply them directly to your thighs! An exfoliating scrub made from the grounds will make your skin smoother and target cellulite.Just as coffee acts as a mild diuretic when we drink it, the caffeine-rich grounds will draw water out of your fat cells, shrinking them so they're less noticeable. Once or twice a week, when you're in the shower, try her scrub:

</li>


<li><h2>Dimple-Fighting Scrub</h2>2 Tbsp used coffee grounds (not decaffeinated) 4 tsp olive oil Combine to make a paste, then spread generously, in upward strokes, over any cellulite-prone areas. Massage in for 2 minutes, then rinse. Note: Your skin will have a slight brownish tint while using this scrub but it will wash away. Also, you (and the shower floor) will be slightly slippery.</li>

<li><h2>Sugaring</h2>.Sugaring or sugar wax is a great homemade alternative for wax. You just need a cup of sugar, squeeze of a lemon and some water. Mix all three and heat on low flame for 5-7 minutes, or until the consistency becomes syrupy and the colour deepens. Use this instead of wax at home to remove hair from your legs.</li>

<li><h2>Coconut oil as a moisturiser</h2>Coconut oil is a great moisturiser for your legs. Apart from keeping your skin soft and smooth it also helps get rid of any marks on your legs, helping you achieve that blemish free look. Use a small amount of coconut oil to massage your legs after a bath. Let your skin absorb it for 10 minutes and then wipe off any excess with a damp towel to avoid staining your clothes.</li>
<li><h2>Heel Soother</h2>If your heel is dry and callused, Monisha Bharadwaj, author of Beauty Secrets of India, suggests blending 3 tablespoons of coconut milk (which has nourishing properties) with 1 teaspoon of chickpea flour (which acts as a “skin polisher”) into a fine paste and leave it on your heels for 15 minutes.</li>
<li><h2>Foot Bath</h2>For tired, dry feet, mix a handful of sea salt, 5 drops of clove oil, and 1 tablespoon of castor oil in a shallow bowl of warm water and soak the feet until the water is cold.Salt and clove boost the circulation and castor oil softens hard skin on the heels and soles.</li>
