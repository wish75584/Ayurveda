		<span style="font-size: 25px">L</span>ooking at constipation from an ayurvedic perspective should shed some light on what’s happening to you. Ayurveda classifies constipation as a vatic disorder, because vata governs movement and elimination (as well as the nervous system). Therefore, anything that aggravates this dosha—stress, tension, travel, dehydration, cold wind, exhaustion, or dry, cold, rough foods—can make your constipation worse</p>
<p>
Because we’re all taught that fiber-rich foods (along with plenty of fluids and exercise) will ameliorate the condition, we naturally figure eating more salads should do the trick. But they don’t, especially for vatic individuals. Raw vegetables are cold and rough—two of the very qualities that unbalance vata—so piling your plate with raw carrots and broccoli won’t work. Constipation (like all vatic excess states) responds to warm, moist, moderately oily, protein-rich foods. Eating soups, stews, casseroles, cooked squash, and moist root vegetables (like turnips and yams)—all of which provide grounding nourishment for a vatic temperament—should help solve the problem. Many of my clients have actually seen symptoms improve once they change their diets.</p>
<p>
Vata excess also causes spasms, especially in the colon and pelvis. Very narrow stools or those shaped like small pellets or balls signal the presence of a spasm in the smooth muscles that make up the wall of the colon. Chronic constipation sufferers need to learn to relax deeply enough so those muscles will remember how to let go. This won’t happen overnight: habitual holding in the pelvis often stems from long-term chronic anxiety, stress, or trauma that will take regular practice to resolve. Agni sara, twists, and forward bends, along with systematic relaxation in shavasana or a similar restorative pose, will move stagnant energy in the pelvis and help unwind chronic gripping.</p>
