	<li><h2>Aloe Vera to Refine Your Pores:</h2><p>To remove dry, dead skin that clogs pores, use this toner before bedtime twice a week. The red tea is rich in zinc and alpha hydroxy acids, which help dissolve the top layer of dead skin cells, and the aloe vera juice restores moisture. WHAT YOU'LL NEED ½ cup distilled water 1 Tbsp rooibos tea (red tea) 1 Tbsp aloe vera juice 2 Tbsp rosewater Brew a cup of red tea and let steep for 20 minutes before removing the bag and placing in the fridge to cool. Then pour the aloe vera juice and rosewater into a bottle, top off with the chilled tea, close cap and shake well. Swipe on skin with a cotton pad. The mixture will last up to a month in your medicine cabinet.</p></li>


<li><h2>Coconut Oil to Banish Dryness</h2>To avoid the annoying itch that winter brings to skin, try swapping your lotion with a body oil. The mix of coconut (hydrates with antimicrobial properties), jojoba (mimics the activity of your body's natural oils) and sweet almond (gently balances skin) works together to end scaliness. WHAT YOU'LL NEED ¼ cup liquid coconut oil ½ cup jojoba oil ¼ cup sweet almond oil 4 vitamin E capsules Combine all three oils in a bottle. Add the vitamin E—an antioxidant that helps fight aging free radicals—by gently piercing the capsulesand squeezing the liquid into the bottle. Close the bottle tight and shake the contents. Apply to your whole body, concentrating on areas that need extra TLC. The oil can be stored for up to a year.</li>

<li><h2>Avocados for a Facial</h2>In a bowl, mix ½ avocado, ½ cup of plain yogurt and ¼ cup of honey until completely blended. Then apply evenly to your face and leave on for 10 minutes. Use a washcloth to gently wipe off, then rinse with water and follow with your regular moisturizer.</li>

<li><h2>Baking Soda to Exfoliate Your Face</h2>Fancy facial scrubs are a fun indulgence from time to time, but a much cheaper option that's just as effective: baking soda. "The tiny granules of sodium bicarbonate buff away pore-clogging dead skin cells and are gentle enough for all skin types," explains Janice Cox, coauthor of Eco Beauty. "Plus, like many other natural salts, baking soda also has slightly antiseptic properties that will ward off breakouts." Cox's suggestion: Make a thin paste with 4 tsp baking soda and 1 Tbsp water, let it sit for 2 minutes, then apply it in small, circular motions to your moistened face (avoiding the eye area) and neck. After 3 minutes, rinse clean with warm water and then follow up with a splash of cold water to close your pores. Finish with a dollop of your regular daily moisturizer. "Dry or sensitive skin types should only use this mask every other week," says Cox. "Those with normal to oily skin can repeat the process weekly."</li>
<li><h2>Mint to Shrink a Pimple</h2>This herb can tackle blemishes without drying skin like harsh acne meds. "Peppermint contains menthol and menthone, compounds that reduce redness and inflammation," says Brian Bonanni, MD, a dermatologist at New York's Gotham LASIK & Skincare. Mint also acts as an astringent, clearing away pimple-causing oil. Dr. Bonanni recommends pulsing a small handful of leaves in a food processor with 1 tsp lemon juice. (The acidic juice temporarily changes the pH of your skin, preventing bacteria growth.) Cover the blemish for 15 minutes, then rinse. Repeat twice a day until the spot is gone.</li>
<li>Don't skip meals!</li>
<li>Include lots of sweet, juicy fruits and green, leafy vegetables in your diet.</li>
<li>Sip warm water through the day to help flush toxins from the body.</li>
