<h2>How To Do Shirshasana</h2>
	<hr style="background-color: coral;height: 2px;border: none;">
	
<ul><li>Place a sturdy, soft blanket on the floor to cushion your head. Then, kneel down on the floor, and interlace your fingers after you place your forearms on the floor. Make sure your elbows are shoulder width apart. Gently nudge your upper arms outward, and firmly press your inner wrists on the floor.</li>
<li>Place the crown of your head on the blanket. Set the base of both your palms together, and fit your crown against your clasped hands.</li>
<li>Breathe in, and lift your knees. Then, walk towards your elbows with your heels lifted off the floor. Now, lift through your thighs such that your body forms an inverted ‘V’. Push your shoulder blades against your back. Then, lift them towards your tailbone so that the front part of your torso is lengthened. This will keep the weight of the shoulders from affecting your head and neck.</li>
<li>As you breathe out, lift your feet off the floor. It is important to lift both the feet together, even if your knees bend slightly as you lift up. Place the legs perpendicular to the floor, and firm up your tailbone against the back portion of your pelvis. Push your heels up towards the ceiling. Your body should be aligned in a straight line.</li>
<li>Keep your weight balanced on both your forearms. Hold the pose for about 10 seconds as a beginner. Keep increasing the time until you can stay in it for up to five minutes or as long as you are comfortable.</li>
</ul>
