It is often used in cleansing rituals and diets to detoxify the liver. While it is known to balance all doshas, turmeric excels at pacifying pitta, therefore making it a perfect remedy for liver diseases. 

The use of turmeric as a defense against liver disease is also supported by research. According to a study that appeared in the journal BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine, curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, may “significantly protect against liver injury by decreasing the activities of serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase and by improving the hepatic glutathione content, leading to a reduced level of lipid peroxidase.”

You can get your daily dose of turmeric by simply adding a teaspoon of turmeric powder as garnishing in your meals. Ayurvedic physicians also recommend consuming a glass of warm milk with a teaspoon of turmeric powder daily.
