		<span style="font-size: 25px">K</span>shara treatment appears to be safe, but there is potential for risk. More research is needed to understand how well they work and how they work.

One study evaluated 30 people experiencing hemorrhoids. Topical application of kshara paste for seven days resulted in the shrinkage of their piles. There were no side effects or adverse effects shown during this treatment. Researchers concluded this treatment would be most effective for first- and second-degree hemorrhoids.

In another case study of kshara chemical cauterization, the patient was symptom-free within 21 days and had no adverse effects or complications. One case study isn’t enough to say cauterization is safe, however.

Kshara sutra procedures have been found to be minimally invasive and low-cost, with a small risk of adverse side effects. These procedures have a few benefits:</p>
	<ul>
<li>They take less time to perform.</li>
<li>People can return to work the next day.</li>
<li>Recovery is less painful than with hemorrhoidectomy.</li>

</ul>

	<h2>Side effects and risks</h2>
	<p>Ayurvedic hemorrhoid treatments like application of kshara paste and kshara sutra ligation have been shown to be safe and effective. If your practitioner or doctor has recommended herbal supplements or medications, be sure to ask about possible side effects.

Cauterization procedures and surgical procedures have much higher risk. Possible side effects include:</p>
	<ul>
<li>damage to tissue</li>
<li>bleeding</li>
<li>pain</li>
<li>infection</li>
<li>shock</li>
<li>leakage of stool</li>
<li>recurrence of hemorrhoids</li>

</ul>
	
	
	<p> can be risky for a person experiencing hemorrhoids to choose the wrong treatment. That means it’s vital to work closely with a knowledgeable practitioner before choosing.

Your doctor will be able to provide you with detailed information about your diagnosis. In the United States, there are guidelines for the care of hemorrhoids, and diagnosis and management of serious hemorrhoids needs to be under the care of a doctor.</p>
