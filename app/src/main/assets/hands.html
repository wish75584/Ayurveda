	<li><h2>Lemons to Remove Dry Patches:</h2>When life gives you lemons, turn them into a remedy for rough, scaly skin. The citric acid removes dead skin cells to expose softer skin below. Slice a lemon in half and rub the cut side over your elbows, heels or knees for a few seconds, then rinse. You'll notice a difference immediately.</li>


<li><h2>Coconut Oil to Banish Dryness</h2>To avoid the annoying itch that winter brings to skin, try swapping your lotion with a body oil. The mix of coconut (hydrates with antimicrobial properties), jojoba (mimics the activity of your body's natural oils) and sweet almond (gently balances skin) works together to end scaliness. WHAT YOU'LL NEED ¼ cup liquid coconut oil ½ cup jojoba oil ¼ cup sweet almond oil 4 vitamin E capsules Combine all three oils in a bottle. Add the vitamin E—an antioxidant that helps fight aging free radicals—by gently piercing the capsulesand squeezing the liquid into the bottle. Close the bottle tight and shake the contents. Apply to your whole body, concentrating on areas that need extra TLC. The oil can be stored for up to a year.</li>

<li><h2>Vitamin E Oil Massage</h2>Soak your hands on warm water for 10 to 15 minutes and then pat dry them. Use a soft cloth to dry your hands, and then apply Vitamin E oil to massage your hands. Vitamin E will keep your hands moisturised for long. You can also use olive oil. It will also keep your moisturised in natural way.</li>

<li><h2>Bedtime Hand Mask</h2>Make a mixture of 1 tablespoon of almond oil (which is nourishing) and 1 teaspoon of buttermilk (which is an astringent, gentle exfoliant), and massage it into your hands. Cover them with cotton gloves and go to sleep. In the morning, remove the gloves and rinse your hands.This will help keep your hands soft and young-looking while strengthening the nails</li>
