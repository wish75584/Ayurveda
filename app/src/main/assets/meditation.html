	Meditation isn’t about becoming a different person, a new person, or even a better person. It’s about training in awareness and getting a healthy sense of perspective. You’re not trying to turn off your thoughts or feelings. You’re learning to observe them without judgment. And eventually, you may start to better understand them as well.
	Meditation works for everyone who is willing to devote some time to the practice. For a beginner, a successful meditation is simply one that leaves you feeling tranquil and rested.Learning to meditate is like learning any other skill. Think of it like exercising a muscle that you’ve never really worked out before. It takes consistent practice to get comfortable. And it’s usually easier if you have a teacher. </p>
	<p>
		When was the last time you sat down in a quiet corner with complete awareness of yourself, your breath and your immediate surroundings? Not in a really long time, isn’t it? We’re so used to ‘multi-tasking’ in our daily lives that being consumed with myriad thoughts, all at once, has become second nature to most of us. We’re zipping through meetings, taking work home, working while on vacation and thinking about the next break when at work. It’s a stressful life and we only have ourselves to blame for it.
	</p>
	<p>Luckily, there are many practices out there that can help calm a stressed mind and body. Meditation is one such practice. It is an inexpensive tool that has infinite benefits. All it asks in return is for you to be patient and consistent. Trying a few times and giving up is just what you need to avoid if you are serious about picking up this ancient way of relaxation. This is not something you will learn overnight. But if you keep at it then the benefits of mediation can be reaped over a lifetime.</p>

	<h2>How does meditation work?</h2>
	<p>The Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) is a part of the Central Nervous System and regulates unconscious functions like the heart rate, digestion and respiration. The Autonomic Nervous System is further divided into Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Nervous Systems. Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) is what is responsible for activities which have a ‘flight-or-fight’ response. Anger, fear, fatigue, stress or in an extreme situation ‘a threat to survival’ – these are the times when the SNS is most active and hormones like cortisol are produced. Meditation calms the Sympathetic Nervous System and activates the Parasympathetic Nervous System or the ‘good’ nervous system. Over a period of time, this regulates the heart rate, blood pressure, sweating among other benefits.

	<h2>Meditation for beginners:</h2>
<p>You don’t have to give up on your favourite foods or stay away from your loved ones if you chose to take up Meditation. In fact, if you have hectic schedule and it feels like hours just whizz by – then meditation is just what the doctor ordered. If you have just started to meditate it will be extremely difficult to sit for hours in a relaxed state of mind. Be practical and don’t have such expectations from yourself initially. Experts say the easiest way to begin is by focusing on your breath and try and increase the duration gradually.

	<h2> 5 simple steps :</h2>
	
	 <ul>
   		<li><h3> Where?</h3>Any part of your home works as long it is quiet and there is no hustle-bustle around. Make sure the place you pick is also well-ventilated..</li>
   		
   		<li><h3>When?</h3> Mornings are suggested by most experts simply because meditation allows you to start off your day on a good note. Having said that, meditation can be done anytime of the day! Don’t go by what others tell you – if middle of the day works for you then go for it. Find a routine that works for you but be regular. A few minutes every day will go a long way in your efforts to master this art.</li>
   		
   		<li><h3>Don’t meditate on a heavy stomach</h3>You don’t want to put yourself to sleep or feel drowsy. At the same time, avoid doing it just before meal-times. The idea is to find a spot in your daily schedule when you are relaxed and not distracted..</li>
   		<li><h3> Close your eyes.</h3>Try to ‘collect’ your thoughts and put them away for a little while. Consciously tell yourself that for this short period of time you will not think about anything else. Take a few minutes and normalise breathing and don’t rush into things.</li>
   		<li><h3>Start by focusing on your breath.</h3>Breathe normally for a few times. If it helps count the number of breaths you take, to begin with. Mediation starts first by controlling your mind to ‘concentrate’ on one thing and not wander off. As you learn to control your thoughts you will find it easier to get into in a ‘thoughtless’ state, and then to stay there longer. Each time your thoughts run away to another topic, you must ‘come back’ to focusing on your breath.</li>
