<p><span style="font-size: 25px">S</span>nakes, which are said to be cold blooded, are found everywhere--in land, sea, grassy and marshy lands, and deserts. Venomous snakes are not found in Antarctica. Most of the snakes found in hot regions are venomous. In cold regions their movement is less. They cannot be seen in winter. They come out freely in spring and summer. In tropical countries, venomous snakes are commonly found. They are quite dangerous, mostly fatal. hence, it is advisable to be on the alert to encounter such dangers. Here are some Ayurvedic remedies for snake and insect bites.</p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: 25px">U</span>sually snakes do not attack humans, unless they are startled or injured. In general, most snakes try to avoid contact with humans. Snake cobras can actively attack humans, but in fact, most snake bites are caused by humans actively capturing or teasing them (accidentally or intentionally making the snake feel threatened)

		<h2>Ayurvedic treatments for snake bites

:</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>The patient should not get panic. Because more deaths occur only when the patient becomes panic. But time is very important in controlling the spread of venom.</li>
	<li>Ayurvedic medicines are given orally. They are available in Ayurvedic pharmacies. Ayurvedic medicines normally have no side effects. Nowadays, Ayurvedic medicines are administered through injections also.</li>
	<li>Ayurveda uses herbs such as nirgundi(Vitex Negundo), kakamaci(Solanum Americanum Miller), black pepper, long pepper, sacred basil, nagatali(Martynia annua), vishaminjil (Crinum latifolium), aloe vera, prickly chaff flower(Achyranthes aspera), and many other common plants found easily in the countryside</li>
	<li>As a home remedy, Ayurveda suggests drinking the juice of banana stem which is very effective in removing poison of insects and snakes.</li>
	<li>Chewing neem(margosa) leaves with salt and black pepper is helpful in removing poison. The person who has poison in the body will taste it sweet while chewing.</li>
	<li>A plant called Sahachara in Ayurveda, botanically called Acanthus ilicifolius, is used for curing snake bite. This anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, anti-osteoporotic, chemopreventive herb is commonly found in tropical countries. Decoction of root, leaves and tender shoots is administered orally.</li>
