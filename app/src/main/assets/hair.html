	<ul><li><h2>Bananas and Honey to Combat Static:</h2><p>Winter hats, blow-drying and low humidity all make your hair more prone to taking flight. Boost your hair's hydration with a mask that features banana and honey, both great for locking in moisture. Plus, the apple cider vinegar removes buildup to enhance shine. WHAT YOU'LL NEED Â½ banana 1 Tbsp honey 1 tsp apple cider vinegar Mash the banana until smooth, then blend in the honey and vinegar. Apply to clean, damp hair and let sit for 15 minutes before rinsing. Follow up with an application of your daily conditioner for extra TLC.</p></li>
<li><h2> General Health: Diet</h2>Diet plays a very important part in the overall health of our hair just like skin. Here are a few additions to your diet as per your hair type that will help you add some glory to your crowning glory.<br>
<h4> Normal Hair:</h4> Fish, chicken, dals, sprouts.<br>
 <h4> Dry Hair:</h4> Raw vegetables, pulses, brown rice, bananas, nuts, vitamin E capsules.<br>
 <h4> Oily Hair:</h4> Green leafy vegetables, salads, fresh fruits, yogurt.</li>
<li><h2>  Amla (Indian gooseberry)</h2>In a discussion of hair fall prevention, you simply can't miss mentioning amla. Ayurveda has it, the vitamins and antioxidants in this fruit are just what you hair need to stay healthy and shining always. Amla works by keeping your hair strong, healthy, shining and free from grays. Drink amla juice regularly or apply amla oil on your hair to reap its benefits. You can also try an amla and henna hair pack. Just mix dry amla powder with henna and yogurt, apply on your hair and rest for 2 hours. Wash it off and apply amla and lemon juice on the roots to strengthen hair follicles</li>
<li><h2>Neem</h2>Neem has been used as the perfect Ayurvedic solution for skin conditions and hair fall. Using neem regularly strengthens roots and improves blood circulation to the scalp. Be it dandruff, lice, dryness or eczema, neem works by resolving all these issues. You can apply neem paste for this or make a neem and water solution. Boil a handful of neem leaves and set aside till it cools. Now strain the solution and set it aside. Wash your hair and for final rinse, use the neem solution. Try this three times a week and see the difference..</li>
<li><h2>Ritha (soap nuts)</h2>For centuries, this Ayuvedic remedy has been used as a natural shampoo by women. Regular usage of ritha improves hair texture and volume. This ingredient is so mild that regular usage does not rob your hair of its natural oils. Just soak a few soap nuts in water overnight and boil them up. Set this aside and use it as a shampoo. Wash your hair with water and pour half of the solution in your hair. Massage for 5 minutes and wash it off with water. Now pour the remaining solution, this time it will produce lather. Practice this every alternate day to see the difference.</li>
<li><h2>Shikakai</h2>Shikakai means fruit for hair. When used with water, it produces lather and can be used as a natural, Ayurvedic shampoo. It helps in restoring scalp health and preventing hair fall. Also, shikakai does not rob your hair of its natural oils. It detangles your hair, clears off dandruff and makes them luscious. Soak dried shikakai powder in water overnight. Use it to wash your hair, just like you wash your hair with ritha. Repeat this every alternate day and see the difference.</li>
<li><h2>Bhringraja (Eclipta Prostrata)</h2>This herb is known as the king of hair because of its benefits for hair. This powerful herb is strong enough to reverse baldness and prevent hair graying. You can apply the oil of this herb or apply the paste of its leaves on your hair. You can also take some dried Bhringraja, add some water to it and apply it on your scalp to strengthen your hair follicles.</li>
