<h1> CALAMUS </h1>
</header>


<section>
<div><p>	<span style="font-size: 25px">A</span>Conscious communication is the essence of yoga. From your chakras to your nervous system to the words you speak, your very molecules are vibrating with the energy of your being, and transmitting that energy to all the other parts of our bodies and to people in your life.


</p>

<p>Yoga exercises, pranayama, and lifestyle practices all support conscious communication, and there is one special herb that yoga reveres above all others for clarifying and expanding that special spiritual voice we all share.</p>

<p>Calamus root is a major herb for the mind and meditation and is highly esteemed by yogis. Though internal consumption is prohibited in the US, it can be used topically, either as a dry powder, paste, or as part of an herbalized oil. From a historical and international perspective, ancient yogis and seers used this herb, and it was said to stimulate the power of self-expression and to enhance intelligence.</p>
	
	<p>This herb was often combined with gotu kola, which is cooling and mild. The complementary energetics made the combination suitable for a wide variety of people. To support attention and focus, it was combined with gotu kola, shankhapushpi, and licorice. Over the long term, calamus warms the body and pacifies the mind. Vacha was also combined with triphala as a general rejuvenative that bestows intelligence, longevity, and good memory.</p>
